# Hitarth Thanki's Resume Through time!

This is a cool little repository I set up to track how my resume is evolving over time using two simple tools, `git` and `Latex`.

I am also itching to find an excuse to learn `Neovim`so this will be my first real "project" done *using* it as my only editor.

## Structure:

#### `Main` Branch

This branch tracks my Main Resume, effectively with all of the most important pieces in it. I will also set up an integration in the future such that My Portfolio will point to this so that the resume on my site is also always up to date. 

#### `Full Stack` Branch

As of typing this, the branch doesn't exist but the goal is to use this resume to apply to all the Fullstack roles I come across. 

#### `Backend` Branch

As of typing this, the branch doesn't exist but the goal is to use this resume to apply to all the Backend roles I come across. 

#### `Cybersec` Branch

As of typing this, the branch doesn't exist but the goal is to use this sub-resume to apply to all the Cybersecurity roles I come across (someday in the future I would like to switch over to Cybersecurity so this will also push me to add meaningful experiences on my Cybersec sub-resume.
